        I recently had the opportunity to interview a fellow classmate as part of an assignment. To give you a little context, I am a graduate student currently pursuing my Masters in Professional Studies in Communication Designs at Parsons The New School. Now the task was simple: interview a class peer about an experience they remember with a particular interface. 
        </p> 
        <p> 
        My interviewee was Han Bao. She usually goes by Joceyln. Or Jo. Now in true millennial fashion, before we got into the nitty-gritties of her interface of choice, we spent some time pondering over our shared miseries. Having gotten that out of the way, we settled in for what ended up being a really interesting conversation that led me down a rabbit hole that left me with more questions than answers. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The interview started off simple. I asked Jo about an interface that really stuck with her. Something that she distinctly remembers. She pondered over this for a bit and then sent me a link to a website called <a href="https://opensea.io/"><em>OpenSea</em></a>. OpenSea is one of the first and largest online non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace; founded by Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah in 2017. Currently, OpenSea is valued at $13.3 billion. (What!?)
        </p>
        <p>    
        Now for those of you (like me) who don’t really understand what NFT’s are, or (again, like me) pretend to know what they are and simply nod along in conversations with crypto-enthusiasts waiting for the nightmare to end; <a href=https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq><em>here’s a great article</em></a> that really breaks it down. However, fair warning, as great as the article is, the more I read up about the world of NFT’s, the more confused I got. 
       </p>
        <p>
        Okay, back to the interview. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Jo stumbled onto the OpenSea interface while doing research for a startup she’s working on called cPond.
        </p>   
        <p>
        What really stood out to Jo about OpenSea’s interface is that it has a very clear design system that does not conflict or take away from the content displayed on the site. Their choice of fonts and colors work really well and allow for easy navigation through the site. OpenSea’s methodically thought out UI & UX design really stuck with her as well, and has become a major source of inspiration for her startup. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Jo’s startup really caught my attention, and on probing a bit further, Jo explained to me that cPond is a platform that will host year long digital art competitions. These competitions will bring together almost 200 artists from across the globe. The premise of the contest is quite interesting. Each artist will have a character to design based on a prompt. Throughout the year, the competition will have 6-7 ‘stops’ or themes (for example, cyberpunk being one of them) and the artists will develop their character based on the theme. What's more, whatever the artists create will be sold on the cPond platform as an NFT. Cool, right?!
        </p>
        <p>
        Turns out, Jo came into contact with this startup by accident. Her partner, who handles the business side of things (for the lack of a better word), never formally studied finance. Jo, on the other hand, had little to no idea about NFT’s and the metaverse and had no experience when it came to buying and selling digital art. They’ve been figuring it all out from scratch, together. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Jo explained that OpenSea was the first website that helped her understand the NFT world. She said ‘..anyone who’s even remotely interested in NFT’s has without a doubt heard of this platform’. And well, rightly so. Before OpenSea, there was no easy way to buy, transfer, sell, and track the ownership of NFT’s. What makes OpenSea unique is that it serves as a bridge between the complicated world of blockchain tech and artists who just want to create and sell digital art. 
        </p>
        <p>
        During the R&D phase of her startup, Jo went through every detail of the OpenSea website to understand the platform both as a buyer and a seller. As a buyer, she wanted to break down what exactly it meant to buy an NFT, how you’d pay for it, and how you’d track it. It’s a bit of a complicated process, she mentioned. It isn’t like buying something from a digital marketplace like Amazon. There’s no fixed price. It’s more of an auction, or similar to trading stocks. As a seller, Jo wanted to grasp how the platform played an important roll in helping both upcoming and experienced artists as they built a career for themselves through NFT’s. 
        </p> 
        <p>
        While she’s extremely familiar with the platform now, Jo mentioned that it took some getting used to. For someone with no knowledge of the field, OpenSea can be a bit overwhelming and at times, confusing. They do, however, have a robust set of resources including guides, practical tips, and support articles for first-time creators and buyers. 
        </p> 
        <p>
        Since 2021, NFT’s have exploded in popularity. A number of websites and interfaces like OpenSea (for example, Rarible, Nifty Getaway, and Block Party to name a few) have popped up in the US trying to stay ahead of the curve. However, this isn’t the case worldwide. Jo mentioned that back in China, where she’s originally from, platforms that cater to buying and selling NFT’s are not as diverse. Unlike OpenSea, interfaces in China have a very straightlaced, corporate (slang for boring) approach to their UI & UX. These interfaces don’t put the artist and the artwork first. Furthermore, on platforms like OpenSea, you could buy or sell digital artworks, music, trading cards, collectibles, virtual worlds - you name it. In China, the collections are much more limited. 
        </p> 
        <p>
        At the end of the interview, I asked Jo whether platforms like OpenSea, or NFT’s in general, have a place in our future. Now, I admit, that was a bit of a stupid question considering ‘NFT’s are the future’ *insert eye roll*. However, considering the whirlwind nature of the NFT and crypto boom, and our diminishing attention span as a species, I can only wonder where we go from here. Jo had a more optimistic view on this topic. She mentioned that as we slowly shift from Web 2 to Web 3, NFT’s will very seamlessly integrate into the metaverse. They simply go hand in hand. The metaverse will, in a way, unlock the true potential of what digital art can do. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Now as I mentioned at the start of the article, this interview was extremely insightful for me considering the fact that so far, I have tried to avoid talking about or making sense of the NFT boom. The less you know the better, right? However, as a creator myself, this conversation was a great catalyst for me to dig a bit deeper and try to make sense of the future of the art world.
        </p>
        <p>
        While I do appreciate the plethora of new and exciting opportunities that NFT’s bring to the table for digital artists, I believe that things have gotten really bizarre, really quick. I don’t think I’ll ever get around to understanding why anyone would pay tens of millions of dollars for a picture of an ape, or a digital cat, or a tweet, for that matter! However, as we continue to unravel the wild wild world of digital art, cryptocurrencies, and the metaverse, I'm filled with a little bit of excitement, and a whole lot of skepticism.
